# MPU6050
Arduino library for the MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope sensor with I2C interface from InvenSense.

## Introduction
The MPU6050 is a motion tracking [device](https://www.invensense.com/products/motion-tracking/6-axis/mpu-6050/) 
from InvenSense. It is I2C controlled, contains a 3-axis gyroscope and a 3-axis Accelerometer (and a thermometer). 
InvenSense has published a
[datasheet](https://43zrtwysvxb2gf29r5o0athu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MPU-6000-Datasheet1.pdf)
but for driver development, the 
[register map](https://43zrtwysvxb2gf29r5o0athu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MPU-6000-Register-Map1.pdf)
is also crucial.

### Background
An [accelerometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerometer) is a device that measures acceleration. 
For example, an accelerometer at rest on the surface of the Earth will measure an acceleration due to 
Earth's gravity of g â‰ˆ 9.81 m/s2. In a typical implementation a mass is hung with one degree of freedom;
it moves due to acceleration. Accelerometers are used in mobile phone and digital cameras so that images 
on screens are always displayed upright. Accelerometers are used in drones for flight stabilisation and 
for drop detection.

A [gyroscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroscope) is a device used for measuring or maintaining orientation.
A typical implementation is a spinning wheel in which the axis of rotation is free to assume any orientation by itself. 
Applications of gyroscopes include  navigation systems.

Gyroscope suffer from drift, so accelerometers are used to compensate for that.

### This project
This project implements an Arduino library for the MPU6050. It comes with some examples.

Note that the MPU6050 requires a supply voltage of 3.3V. So, Arduino's 5.0V *not* OK. 
However, some boards, like the GY521 have an on-board voltage regulator and level shifter.

## Getting started

Steps to get started
 - Make sure you have a Nano and an MPU6050, and wire them together
 - Make sure you have the Arduino IDE and install this library
 - Open, compile, flash and run one of the examples

These steps are discussed in details below

### Hardware

The hardware steps to take

 - You need an Arduino, e.g. an [Arduino Nano](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-nano).
   I got a cheap [clone](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000427291663.html) with a USB micro plug.
 - You need an MPU6050. I got a [GY521 breakout board](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000504535389.html)
   with a 5V to 3V regulator.
 - This library is simple; it only uses the I2C lines. So 4 wires need to be connected.
   I did not add pull-ups, the ones in the Nano appear sufficient.

### Software

The software steps to take

 - It is assumed that you that the Arduino IDE has been installed. If not, refer to "Install the Arduino Desktop IDE" 
   on the [Arduino site](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage). If you follow the default install, libraries
   will install here (for me, Maarten) `C:\Users\maarten\Documents\Arduino\libraries`.
 - Install the library
    - Visit the project page for the [Arduino MPU6050 library](https://github.com/maarten-pennings/MPU6050).
    - Click the green button `Clone or download` on the right side, and from the pop-up choose Download ZIP.
    - Start Arduino, select from menu `Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library...` and select the just downloaded ZIP file. 
    - An alternative to the last step is to manually add the library: 
      Unzip the file "Here", and copy the entire tree to the Arduino library directory. This `README.md` should 
      be located at e.g. `C:\Users\maarten\Documents\Arduino\libraries\MPU6050\README.md`.

### Example

Running the example 

 - Restart Arduino IDE and `Open File > Example > Examples from Custom Libraries > MPU6050 > basic`.
 - Make sure `Tools > Board` has `Arduino Nano`, `Tools > Processor` has the right bootloader (old for me), and
   `Tools > Port` has the correct COM port.
 - Select `Sketch > Upload` to compile and upload the example to the Nano.
 - Open the ` Tools > Serial Monitor` (at 115200 baud) and see the output

Notes on the example
 - On the first line see a general banner for the example application
 - On the second line see the version of the library
 - On the third line, the application checks if the MPU6050 is present (correctly connected).
   Unfortunately, the Arduino I2C library does not feature a time-out when an I2C device is not responding.
   So if it takes a forever for the `present` to appear, you likely have a connection problem.
 - The next line (with `success`) gives the status of the `MPU6050.begin()` call.
   This call wakes-up the device, configures it, calibrates it.
   If it does not say `success` you have a problem.
 - Every next lines shows feedback from one measurement.
